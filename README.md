### Problem Statement

The providers in my department are required to bill a certain amount of hours per month, 
as determined by the hospital. They are currently using an Excel spreadsheet to monitor 
their billable hours accrued. The providers are also using the same spreadsheet to keep 
track of the progress of their reports. The problem with this Excel spreadsheet is that 
it is not easy to understand and use, especially for those providers who are not 
well-versed in Excel. Formulas have also been accidentally deleted or changed.

I would like to build a website that providers can easily use to track their billable hours
and reports.
